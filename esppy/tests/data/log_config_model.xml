  This is a simple model used as input to the XML server to show how to use a log
  configuration XML file to determine how to configure logging services rather than
  the defaults that get used when no logging configuration file is provided.  The log
  configuration file is specified as an option to the XML server:
  -logconfig log_config.xml

  The actual model does not have any input or output defined.

  It is worth looking at the xml-based configuration file to see how one can setup
  log appenders that enable logging to go to files, apps, console, ....
