 <description>
  This is a simple example that has one source window and one filter
  window. The filter window has a registered Boolean filter function.

  engine element creates the single engine top level container which sets up dfESP
  fundamental services such as licensing, logging, pub/sub, ...
  This single engine instance wraps one or more projects, that wrap
  one or more continuous queries and different types of windows.

 <projects>
  <project name='project' pubsub='auto' threads='1'>
   <description>
    This is to create a project. Project specifies a container
    that holds one or more continuous queries and are backed by a
    thread pool of user defined size. One can specify the pubsub
    port and type, number of threads for the project, index type
    and if using Tag Token data flow model.

   <contqueries>
    <contquery name='contQuery' trace='filterWindow'>
     <description>
      This specifies the continuous query container that holds
      a collection of windows and enables one to specify the
      connectivity between windows. One can turn on tracing
      for a list of window and specifies the index type for
      windows in the query.
     </description>
     <windows>
      <window-source name='sourceWindow'>
       <description>
        This defines a source window. All event streams must
        enter continuous queries by being published or
        injected into a source window.

       <description>
        This is a filter window with a registered Boolean
        filter function. The function is defined in the
        shared library plugin.{so,dll} and the function name is
        booleanScalarFunction.
