The ESPPy package enables you to create 
`SAS Event Stream Processing (ESP) <https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/event-stream-processing.html>`_
models programmatically in Python.  Using ESPPy, you can connect to
an ESP server and interact with projects and their components as
Python objects. These objects include projects, continuous queries,
windows, events, loggers, SAS Micro Analytic Service modules,
routers, and analytical algorithms. 

ESPPy has full integration with `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ notebooks
including visualizing diagrams of your ESP projects, and support for
streaming charts and images.  This allows you to easily explore and
prototype your ESP projects in a familiar notebook interface.
